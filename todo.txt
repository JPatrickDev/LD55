Game over when too many mobs get through


Exp
    - Mobs drop something when they die?/
        - This then can be spent on card pieces?/
        - "Runes"?/
            - They float towards the nearest tower?
            - Just fade after a few seconds?/
                - With an animation this might be OK

Towers/Mobs should have sprites that are taller than 1 tile, if mobs/towers are rendered in order of depth(If you render mobs/towers at the lowest Y values(closest to bottom of screen)
 first) it should give a sense of depth?/

Rounds
Next Round UI/
    - Exp gathered can be spent on existing towers, or unlocking a new card
        - Maybe the cards are auto-unlocked based on current round, so runes are just spent on cards
Number of mobs per round increases, with some randomness added
Every multiple of 3, a new mob type is introduced?
    - Speed/health differences

Mobs
    - Some mobs can hurt towers?
        - Passive towers can counter this?
    - Difference sprites depending on direction they are moving/facing
    - Walking animations/

Tower Placement
    - Show range when placing/
        - Instead of just a circle, highlight the path tiles inside the circle?/
    - Show grid only when placing?/

Level
    - Randomise stone placement?
    - At least three levels
    - Level selection screen
        - Render preview

Cards
    - Hovering over a card "flips" it, showing a more detailed description on the back
    - Some cards upgrade existing towers
        -- Applies to towers already placed
    - Unwanted cards can be discarded
        - Possible tactical element of keeping a good but expensive card vs discarding and getting a new one you can currently afford

Towers
    - Ice Tower/
       - Freezes path tiles - Show visually which tiles are affected/


 Bugs:
    - Ice tower can break movement if placed just before the final corner
