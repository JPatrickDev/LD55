Game over when too many mobs get through


Exp
    - Mobs drop something when they die?
        - This then can be spent on card pieces?
        - "Runes"?
            - They float towards the nearest tower?
            - Just fade after a few seconds?
                - With an animation this might be OK

Towers/Mobs should have sprites that are taller than 1 tile, if mobs/towers are rendered in order of depth(If you render mobs/towers at the lowest Y values(closest to bottom of screen)
 first) it should give a sense of depth?

Rounds
Next Round UI
    - Exp gathered can be spent on existing towers, or unlocking a new card
Number of mobs per round increases, with some randomness added
Every multiple of 3, a new mob type is introduced?
    - Speed/health differences

Mobs
    - Some mobs can hurt towers?
        - Passive towers can counter this?
    - Difference sprites depending on direction they are moving/facing
    - Walking animations

Tower Placement
    - Show range when placing/
    - Show grid only when placing?

Level
    - Randomise stone placement?
    -
