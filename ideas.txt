Tower Defence?
    - You summon towers
    - Magic Theme to everything
    - Real time
    - Cards?
        - Each tower is represented as a card
        - End of each round you get X card pieces(Runes? Something more magicy)
        - You can choose to spend the pieces on more of an existing card, or unlock a new tower type
            - Maybe you get 1 free card when you unlock the new type, or it's V expensive to unlock new cards and it'll probably be better strat to just spam tier 1 towers
    - You can cast spells(Or summon something...?)
        - Temporarily slow down all mobs
